## Implementing the JS
You are welcome to use any JS in this repo, subject to the terms of <a href="https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/JS-lib/blob/main/LICENSE">`LICENSE.md`</a>. Note that all the scripts must be linked in your HTML files. If you have any questions, <a href="https://owelton-rosie.pages.dev/">contact me</a>. 

### Quickstart implementation guide
- First, navigate to the JavaScript file you wish to use and copy or download the code
- Secondly, add the file to your workspace
  * Any file named `sw.js` is a service worker file and must be placed in your workspace's <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-root-folder-or-root-directory-2625989">`root`</a> directory
- Once you've added the file to your workspace, you'll need to place it in your `HTML` file. The code will look something like this:
```
 <script src="script.js"></script>
```

If you're placing the scripts in a separate directory, the `HTML` structure would look something like this:
```
<script src="./scripts/script.js"></script>
```
